# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Description

Our project is an audio-based recognition system for activity. It's designed to analyze various sound events, such as clapping, snapping, and hitting a desk and classify them accordingly. The system leverages Docker for scalability, and operates in a containerized environment, as per the instructions.
